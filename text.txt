Hello , I'm afaf , a functionnal consultant and I believe that there is always something new to learn .
My goal for this month is to learn the basics of GIT , and for this journey I've chosen kudvenkat tutoriel , it's an amazing teacher who knows how to convey easily the information.

In the first session , I learned what's the difference between Git and GitHub , how to create a public repository in my a GutHub account and the difference between public and private repository .
In today's session I learned how to configure git for windows , how to clone a repository into my local machine using the clone git command , and how to get the latest changes from GitHub repository into my local machine 
In the next session , I'll learn to commit changes made on my local machine to the github repository. 
#ThankYou , #Mr.Venkat.
